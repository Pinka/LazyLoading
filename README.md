## Running the Examples

Most examples can be run by simply opening the HTML files in a browser. Some examples may require a local server to function properly.

```bash
# Using Python to start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js with http-server (requires installation)
npx http-server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/examples/`
