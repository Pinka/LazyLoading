# Lazy Loading Techniques

This repository contains a comprehensive application demonstrating various lazy loading techniques in modern web development.

## About the Project

This project provides practical implementations of different lazy loading strategies, allowing you to see real-world examples of how to improve your web application's performance through lazy loading.

## Examples Included

The application is organized into four main categories of lazy loading techniques:

### 1. Image Lazy Loading

- **Native Lazy Loading**: Using the browser's built-in `loading="lazy"` attribute
- **Intersection Observer API**: Implementing custom image lazy loading with the Intersection Observer API

### 2. Component Lazy Loading

- **Dynamic Imports**: Loading UI components on demand using dynamic import functionality
- **React Suspense**: Using React's built-in `lazy()` and `Suspense` features for code splitting

### 3. Route-based Lazy Loading

- **SPA Route Lazy Loading**: Implementing route-based code splitting in a single-page application

### 4. Data Lazy Loading

- **Infinite Scroll**: Incrementally loading data as the user scrolls, using Intersection Observer

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

Each example highlights specific benefits of lazy loading:

- Reduced initial load time
- Improved performance metrics
- Decreased bandwidth usage
- Enhanced user experience
- Efficient resource allocation

## How to Run the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd lazy-loading

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Implementation Details

### Image Lazy Loading

- The native lazy loading example demonstrates the simplest implementation using HTML's loading attribute
- The Intersection Observer example shows a more customizable approach with transitions and placeholders

### Component Lazy Loading

- The dynamic imports example shows how to load heavy UI components only when needed
- The React Suspense example demonstrates React's built-in code splitting capabilities with fallback states

### Route-based Lazy Loading

- The SPA example demonstrates how to load different "page" modules only when their route is accessed
- Includes hash-based routing with real code splitting visible in DevTools

### Data Lazy Loading

- The infinite scroll example shows how to efficiently load data in batches as the user scrolls
- Implements proper loading states and scroll position tracking

## How to Use These Examples in Your Projects

Each example is designed to be easily adapted for your own projects:

1. Look at the implementation in the source code
2. Review the explanations provided on each example page
3. Open your browser's DevTools (especially the Network tab) to see the lazy loading in action
4. Adapt the patterns to fit your specific use case

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- Modern browser with DevTools for best experience
